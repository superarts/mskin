Skins of gmplayer are already 'open' enough, but using Google Code to do some version control works is not a bad idea too, I guess. Anyway, this is a simple project that allows you:

1. Installing skins within this project:
Pretty easy job. Just checkout the source to your (hopefully) ~/.mplayer/skins/. No need to unpack, no need to have any release.
So no tags...

2. Making your own skins based on current ones:
Checkout the source, copy the skin folder to another one (your own skin branch), and apply the modifications in your branched folder.
So no branches...

3. Adding new skins:
Checkin your new skin folder will do the job. So trunk only.
